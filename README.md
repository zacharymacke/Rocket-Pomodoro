## Rocket Timer

ðŸš€ timer is a simple [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) that has a unique space twist. 

It is built entirely with vanilla Javascript and was meant to be a beginner/intermediate project that taught fundamental skills such as DOM manipulation, styling, and more advanced Javascript techniques. 

It uses the standard pomodoro timer logic:

- 5:00 - 60:00 min work period
- 0:00 - 15:00 min break period
- 1 - 4 cycles, following above chosen intervals where you are working, distraction free, with a break period immediately after each work period.
